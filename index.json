One type of data in particular, Single-cell RNA Sequencing data, allow for a cell-level detection of biological patterns but technical limitations add lots of noise sources to the data. In particular, some counts are dropped and appear as zeros, even thought the gene is expressed in the cell. Here, we present a new method to detect dropouts in cases of development trajectories. Our various model all improve substantially on random guesses and offer a computationally-efficient way to infer correct gene expression patterns over time.

Together, we hence build the following list of interesting material. Those fall into 4 broad (and largely overlapping) categories:\n How to produce data with sequencing How to find, access and pre-process data (including how to use bio-informatics tools) How to analyze the data: statistics How to use all of the above to conduct an analysis (with - of course - a strong emphasis on R tools) How to do all those analyses correctly: reproducible research  I\u0026rsquo;ll therefore try to list resources to help in all subjects. This will be a mix of (scientific) papers, books, package vignette, personal tutorials, video\u0026hellip;\nIf you find any other relevant material, feel free to put an issue on the github repo.\nBefore we begin The resources below broadly assume that you have at least a basic knowledge of R, statistics and biology.\nOtherwise, for R, I recommend (and I am far from the only one) Garrett Grolemund \u0026amp; Hadley Wickham\u0026rsquo;s R For Data Science. Additionally, the statistical computing facility at Berkeley host yearly R bootcamp. The material is on Github and are a great way to practice (this is how I really learned R, and I had the change to help in the teaching in 2018).\nBiological concept you should be familiar with are (with links to the relevant Wikipedia pages): the Central Dogma, mRNA splicing. Keeping up to date with the current knowledge on majors diseases is also crucial to .\nFor statistics, I do not have any material to recommend.\nSequencing methodology  RNA - Sequencing mostly relies on Illumina Sequencing nowadays but it\u0026rsquo;s useful to learn about other sequencing methods. I feel that for this, videos are the best medium to understand the mechanisms.  Sanger sequencing The first method used for sequening. The video below gives a 3mn tutorial on how it works.   Illumina Sequencing Also called Next Generation Sequencing or Short read sequencing. The best resources I have found come from the Illumina Website   PacBio Sequencing Long read sequencing, 2$^nd$ generation of NGS. In very, short, longer reads with lower accuracy compared to Illumina reads   Oxford NanoPore sequencing Even longer reads with even lower quality.  \n Single-cell RNA-Sequencing is, of course, conducted at the single-cell level. The way the cells are pre-processed, separated and sequenced is method-dependent. A good overview of those methods can be found in Svensson et al.\n Many other different types of \u0026lsquo;omics exist: the youtube chanel StatQuest gives a good intro to many of them (as well as clear explanations for many statistical analyses). Some \u0026lsquo;omics that are often collected along RNA-Seq are Chip-Seq and ATAC-Seq.\n  Prepping the data for analysis Obtaining data The R GEOQuery package from Bioconductor allows you to download data and sample information from ncbi.\nPre-processing data The sequencing step produces reads at the cell level. The next question is how to map them to a reference genome to obtain transcript or gene expression levels. To obtain this matrix, a few bioinformatic tools exist. One series of tool is Tophat, which was replaced by Tophat2 and then HISAT, which was finally upgraded to HISAT2. A popular alternative is the STAR algorithm.\nRecently, tools that do not rely on full genome alignment have been proposed, including Kallisto and Salmon. A recent (not yet per-reviewed comparison) can be found by here.\nTo run those scripts, basic knowledge of shell scripting is needed. Good tutorials can be found here or here.\nPre-processed data. Many datasets have been stored in a clean format in the recount2 project. This is an excellent place to start if you want to explore algorithms on real world and diverse datasets.\nThe Bioconductor Project also has a lot of datasets packages.\nTools needed for analysis Many excellent books exist to give a clear understanding of the many tools and concept needed. Freedman\u0026rsquo;s book, Statistical Models: Theory and Practice is a must-read, which I consider maybe closer to a philosophical treaty. More applied, Susan\u0026rsquo;s Holmes new book, Modern Statistics for Modern Biology is quite complete for tools used in genomics. Key concepts include dimensionality reduction, clustering and modelling. A deeper and mathier book is the The Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani \u0026amp; Friedman.\nA central concept in high-dimensional statistics that characterize genomics is multiple hypothesis testing. Efron (2010) is a good reference with a clear Baysien justification. This paper present the concepts in a genomic setting.\nThe R language is used in many RNA-Seq applications. To improve your coding practices, I also recommend advanced R by Hadley Wickham.\nApplications to RNA-Seq We\u0026rsquo;re finally getting to the RNA-Seq analysis part. To start, I advice to begin with a practical tutorial. The Bioconductor 2018 Workshop provides a few that I recommend. This other one is longer but more complete. This other tutorial that I wrote is shorter but can be a good place to start.\nOnce you have seen how to proceed, this recent review by Koen et al. is a good follow-up that very nicely recoup many concepts from above and can point you to further resources.\nThen, I recommend to dive into method papers. This list is partly inspired from the Leek group paper.\n Sequencing technology does not eliminate biological variability The first paper behind the Limma package and the second, with voom edgeR Key need for Normalization, especially because of batch effects Methods for normalization include scone, zinbWave and scVI. Seurat which propose a global framework of analysis This paper (not yet per-reviewed) propose a nice overview of trajectory inference Gene Set Enrichment Analysis  Reproducible research All the analyses you conduct should aim for reproducibility in the science. A first step to try and limit the crisis of reproducibilty in science - and one where biostatisticians have a key role - is statistical and computational reproducibility. To help, several tool exist. Git and Github are powerful tools and many good tutorial exist (see here for example). Good coding practices are also necessary. Saving your software in packages part of it, and this book is a good reference on how to build them. I also recommend using tools like R Markdown or R Sweave to combine text, math, code and figures in one coherent place.\nThis nature collection group of papers gives a broad overview of the issue of reproducibility, and of how to fix it.\n","date":1524034800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524034800,"objectID":"19d8cb35125940bbead104a974f1c848","permalink":"/project/ressources/","publishdate":"2018-04-18T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/ressources/","section":"project","summary":"Currated list of resources that could be usefullto beginners (or not) when learning how dive into RNA-Seq Analysis","tags":["Tutorials","Research"],"title":"Welcome to the RNA-Seq world","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
