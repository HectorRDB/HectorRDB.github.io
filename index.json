The project report is available on Overleaf and may be read here.  Report abstract The explosion of genomic data over the past two decades created a need for new and more performing tools. One type of data in particular, Single-cell RNA Sequencing data, allow for a cell-level detection of biological patterns but technical limitations add lots of noise sources to the data. In particular, some counts are dropped and appear as zeros, even thought the gene is expressed in the cell. Here, we present a new method to detect dropouts in cases of development trajectories. Our various model all improve substantially on random guesses and offer a computationally-efficient way to infer correct gene expression patterns over time.
