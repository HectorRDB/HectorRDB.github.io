One type of data in particular, Single-cell RNA Sequencing data, allow for a cell-level detection of biological patterns but technical limitations add lots of noise sources to the data. In particular, some counts are dropped and appear as zeros, even thought the gene is expressed in the cell. Here, we present a new method to detect dropouts in cases of development trajectories. Our various model all improve substantially on random guesses and offer a computationally-efficient way to infer correct gene expression patterns over time.

I think that the ressources I recommand fall into 4 broad (and largely overlapping) categories:\n Biology and techniques How to find, acess and pre-process data (including how to use bio-informatics tools) Statistics How to use all of the above to conduct an analysis (with - of course - a strong emphasis on R tools)  I\u0026rsquo;ll therefore try to list ressources to help in all subjects. This will be a mix of (scientific) papers, books, package vignette, personal tutorials, video\u0026hellip;\nIf you find any other ressources, feel free to contact me.\nBefore we begin Those ressources assume that you have at least a basic knowledge of R, statistics and biology. For R otherwise, I recommand (and I am far from the only one) Garrett Grolemund \u0026amp; Hadley Wickham\u0026rsquo;s R For Data Science. Any suggestions for biology and statistics introductory guides are weclome.\nBiology and techniques Koen review Central dogma Illumina video Sanger sequencing\nGetting your hands on data A first - and excellent - ressource of good pre-processed data is the recount2 project.\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2012.016 Kallisto\nSTAR\nLink to bash tuto\nscript for pubmed (diya)\nStatistics Susan\u0026rsquo;s Holmes Modern Statistics for Modern Biology Dim reduction (link rebecca\u0026rsquo;s slide with permission or actually build tuto) Clustering (link to book chapter)\nhttps://github.com/jtleek/genomicspapers\nApplications to RNA-Seq https://github.com/jtleek/genomicspapers as well\nsalens review EDA: Rebecca\u0026rsquo;s ggplot tutorial (make a new one more bio focused?
