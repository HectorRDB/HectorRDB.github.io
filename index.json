Subgraphs of $\\mathcal{G}$ can then serve to design new covariates, yielding an enriched representation of the data. Testing the association of these new covariates to an outcome of interest can provide more insight on critical biological processes. However, the number of subgraphs is often exponential in the number of original covariates. Therefore, a method testing all possible subgraphs would have very low power, due to multiple testing corrections and could quickly become computationally intractable. The concept of testable hypothesis has been used to simultaneously address both issues in similar contexts. Here, we introduce a method leveraging this concept to test all closed connected subgraphs, i.e., those which are not included in a larger one leading to the exact same covariate. We propose a novel enumeration scheme for these objects which fully exploits the pruning opportunity offered by testability, leading to drastic improvements in speed. We illustrate this improvement on both real and simulated datasets. This paves the way for numerous applications in biomedicine, especially for genome-wide association studies in bacterial genomes.","tags":"Main Work","title":"Finding All Significant Closed Connected Subgraphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kelly Street","Koen Van den Berge","Hector Roux de Bézieux"],"categories":[""],"content":"In single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), gene expression is assessed at the level of single cells.

Second, cross-species analysis achieves a unified taxonomy of transcriptomic types and their hierarchical organization that are conserved from mouse to marmoset and human. Third, cross-modal analysis provides compelling evidence for the epigenomic, transcriptomic, and gene regulatory basis of neuronal phenotypes such as their physiological and anatomical properties, demonstrating the biological validity and genomic underpinning of neuron types and subtypes. Fourth, in situ single-cell transcriptomics provides a spatially-resolved cell type atlas of the motor cortex. Fifth, integrated transcriptomic, epigenomic and anatomical analyses reveal the correspondence between neural circuits and transcriptomic cell types. We further present an extensive genetic toolset for targeting and fate mapping glutamatergic projection neuron types toward linking their developmental trajectory to their circuit function.

With the proliferation of taxonomies based on individual datasets, a major challenge is to integrate and validate results toward defining biologically meaningful cell types. We used a battery of single-cell transcriptome and epigenome measurements generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) to comprehensively assess the molecular signatures of cell types in the mouse primary motor cortex (MOp). We further developed computational and statistical methods to integrate these multimodal data and quantitatively validate the reproducibility of the cell types. The reference atlas, based on more than 600,000 high quality single-cell or -nucleus samples assayed by six molecular modalities, is a comprehensive molecular account of the diverse neuronal and non-neuronal cell types in MOp. Collectively, our study indicates that the mouse primary motor cortex contains over 55 neuronal cell types that are highly replicable across analysis methods, sequencing technologies, and modalities. We find many concordant multimodal markers for each cell type, as well as thousands of genes and gene regulatory elements with discrepant transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures. These data highlight the complex molecular regulation of brain cell types and will directly enable design of reagents to target specific MOp cell types for functional analysis.","tags":["Collaboration"],"title":"An integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic atlas of mouse primary motor cortex cell types","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David H Brann","Tatsuya Tsukahara","Caleb Weinreb","Marcela Lipovsek","Koen Van den Berge","Boying Gong","Rebecca Chance","Iain C Macaulay","Hsin-Jung Chou","Hector Roux de Bézieux"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609924491,"objectID":"10ed83e31214e7595898cb1a5988be98","permalink":"http://hector-rdb.org/publication/brann/","publishdate":"2021-01-06T09:14:50.761247Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brann/","section":"publication","summary":"Altered olfactory function is a common symptom of COVID-19, but its etiology is unknown. A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) – the causal agent in COVID-19 – affects olfaction directly, by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing demonstrated that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell sequencing revealed that ACE2 is expressed in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells, rather than in neurons. Immunostaining confirmed these results and revealed pervasive expression of ACE2 protein in dorsally-located olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells and olfactory bulb pericytes in the mouse. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients.","tags":["Collaboration"],"title":"Non-neuronal expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in the olfaory system suggests mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated anosmia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Koen Van den Berge","Hector Roux de Bézieux","Kelly Street","Wouter Saelens","Robrecht Cannoodt","Yvan Saeys","Sandrine Dudoit","Lieven Clement"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556722800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556722800,"objectID":"e971b856c635c23ad789a80702fd97f9","permalink":"http://hector-rdb.org/publication/tradeseq/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tradeseq/","section":"publication","summary":"Trajectory inference has radically enhanced single-cell RNA-seq research by enabling the study of dynamic changes in gene expression.

We evaluate the method on simulated datasets and on real datasets from droplet-based and full-length protocols, and show that it yields biological insights through a clear interpretation of the data.\n","date":1524009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524009600,"objectID":"73a0ddc95afbbcdb9a85705d4fef40b1","permalink":"http://hector-rdb.org/project/tradeseq/","publishdate":"2018-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tradeseq/","section":"project","summary":"Trajectory-based differential expression analysis for single-cell sequencing data","tags":["Research"],"title":"tradeSeq","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview Recently, Philippe Boileau joined the Dudoit lab and I had to think on which resources to point him to so that he could start getting up to speed with on the field. Together, we hence build the following list of interesting material. Those fall into 4 broad (and largely overlapping) categories:\n How to produce data with sequencing How to find, access and pre-process data (including how to use bio-informatics tools) How to analyze the data: statistics How to use all of the above to conduct an analysis (with - of course - a strong emphasis on R tools) How to do all those analyses correctly: reproducible research  I\u0026rsquo;ll therefore try to list resources to help in all subjects. This will be a mix of (scientific) papers, books, package vignette, personal tutorials, video\u0026hellip;\nIf you find any other relevant material, feel free to put an issue on the github repo.\nBefore we begin The resources below broadly assume that you have at least a basic knowledge of R, statistics and biology.\nOtherwise, for R, I recommend (and I am far from the only one) Garrett Grolemund \u0026amp; Hadley Wickham\u0026rsquo;s R For Data Science. Additionally, the statistical computing facility at Berkeley host yearly R bootcamp. The material is on Github and are a great way to practice (this is how I really learned R, and I had the change to help in the teaching in 2018).\nBiological concept you should be familiar with are (with links to the relevant Wikipedia pages): the Central Dogma, mRNA splicing. Keeping up to date with the current knowledge on majors diseases is also crucial to .\nFor statistics, I do not have any material to recommend.\nSequencing methodology  RNA - Sequencing mostly relies on Illumina Sequencing nowadays but it\u0026rsquo;s useful to learn about other sequencing methods. I feel that for this, videos are the best medium to understand the mechanisms.  Sanger sequencing The first method used for sequening. The video below gives a 3mn tutorial on how it works.   Illumina Sequencing Also called Next Generation Sequencing or Short read sequencing. The best resources I have found come from the Illumina Website   PacBio Sequencing Long read sequencing, 2$^nd$ generation of NGS. In very, short, longer reads with lower accuracy compared to Illumina reads   Oxford NanoPore sequencing Even longer reads with even lower quality.  \n  Single-cell RNA-Sequencing is, of course, conducted at the single-cell level. The way the cells are pre-processed, separated and sequenced is method-dependent. A good overview of those methods can be found in Svensson et al.\n  Many other different types of \u0026lsquo;omics exist: the youtube chanel StatQuest gives a good intro to many of them (as well as clear explanations for many statistical analyses). Some \u0026lsquo;omics that are often collected along RNA-Seq are Chip-Seq and ATAC-Seq.\n  Prepping the data for analysis Obtaining data The R GEOQuery package from Bioconductor allows you to download data and sample information from ncbi. Most papers provide GEO accession numbers as a key to access their data and is usually enough.\nPre-processing data The sequencing step produces reads at the cell level. The next question is how to map them to a reference genome to obtain transcript or gene expression levels. To obtain this matrix, a few bioinformatic tools exist. One series of tool is Tophat, which was replaced by Tophat2 and then HISAT, which was finally upgraded to HISAT2. A popular alternative is the STAR algorithm.\nRecently, tools that do not rely on full genome alignment have been proposed, including Kallisto and Salmon. A recent (not yet per-reviewed comparison) can be found by here.\nTo run those scripts, basic knowledge of shell scripting is needed. Good tutorials can be found here or here.\nAlso, sequencing data can be stored into many different formats. This page is a very complete overview of the types of format and list tools to convert from one to another.\nPre-processed data. Many datasets have been stored in a clean format in the recount2 project. This is an excellent place to start if you want to explore algorithms on real world and diverse datasets.\nThe conquer project has a shorter list of very well processed datasets, using Salmon.\nThe Bioconductor Project also has a lot of datasets packages.\nTools needed for analysis Many excellent books exist to give a clear understanding of the many tools and concept needed. Freedman\u0026rsquo;s book, Statistical Models: Theory and Practice is a must-read, which I consider maybe closer to a philosophical treaty. More applied, Susan\u0026rsquo;s Holmes new book, Modern Statistics for Modern Biology is quite complete for tools used in genomics. Key concepts include dimensionality reduction, clustering and modelling. A deeper and mathier book is the The Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani \u0026amp; Friedman.\nA central concept in high-dimensional statistics that characterize genomics is multiple hypothesis testing. Efron (2010) is a good reference with a clear Baysien justification. This paper present the concepts in a genomic setting.\nThe R language is used in many RNA-Seq applications. To improve your coding practices, I also recommend advanced R by Hadley Wickham. The S4 section of the book will be of particular interest, given that Bioconductor strongly recommands using S4 objects and functions.\nApplications to RNA-Seq We\u0026rsquo;re finally getting to the RNA-Seq analysis part. To start, I advice to begin with a practical tutorial. The Bioconductor 2018 Workshop provides a few that I recommend. This other one is longer but more complete. This other tutorial that I wrote is shorter but can be a good place to start.\nOnce you have seen how to proceed, this recent review by Koen, et al. is a good follow-up that very nicely recoup many concepts from above and can point you to further resources.\nThen, I recommend to dive into method papers. This list is partly inspired from the Leek group paper.\n Sequencing technology does not eliminate biological variability The first paper behind the Limma package and the second, with voom edgeR Key need for Normalization, especially because of batch effects Methods for normalization include scone, zinbWave and scVI. Seurat is a global framework of analysis Clustering is a key step of RNA-Seq analysis. This paper contrasts several methods on real and synthetic data. This paper proposes a nice overview of trajectory inference Gene Set Enrichment Analysis  Reproducible research All the analyses you conduct should aim for reproducibility in the science. This nature collection group of papers gives a broad overview of the issue of reproducibility, and of how to fix it. A first step to try and limit the crisis of reproducibilty in science - and one where (bio)-statisticians have a key role - is statistical and computational reproducibility.\nTo help, several tool exist. Git and Github are powerful tools and many good tutorial exist (see here for example). Good coding practices are also necessary. Saving your software in packages is a part of it, and this book is a good reference on how to build them in an efficient fashion. I also recommend using tools like RMarkdown or knitr to combine text, math, code and figures in one coherent place when writing papers, reports or even for day-to-day analyses.\nWhile code is now commonly saved and made public for reproducibility purposes, data is unfortunatly not always available. Raw files can be made accessible through ncbi. Pre-processed data (a count matrix for example) can also be made public using a data R package, such as the experiment packages that can be found in Bioconductor.\n","date":1524009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524009600,"objectID":"e09eb38b54d1ef2518c174f04ef547dd","permalink":"http://hector-rdb.org/project/resources/","publishdate":"2018-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/resources/","section":"project","summary":"Currated list of resources that could be useful to beginners (or not) when learning how dive into RNA-Seq Analysis","tags":["Tutorials","Research"],"title":"Welcome to the RNA-Seq world","type":"project"},{"authors":["Gauthier Croizat","Alexandre Kehren","Hector Roux de Bézieux","Abdul Barakat"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1518048000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609924491,"objectID":"60083223b6910542b99fb54f7ddf6a5c","permalink":"http://hector-rdb.org/publication/aortic/","publishdate":"2018-02-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aortic/","section":"publication","summary":"Shear stress plays an important role in the creation and evolution of atherosclerosis. An key element for in-vivo measurements and extrapolations is the dependence of shear stress on body mass. In the case of a Poiseuille modeling of the blood flow, P. Weinberg and C. Ethier have shown that shear stress on the aortic endothelium varies like body mass to the power $\\frac{−3}{8}$, and is therefore 20-fold higher in mice than in men. However, by considering a more physiological oscillating Poiseuille + Womersley combinated flow in the aorta, we show that results differ notably: at larger masses ($M10 kg$) shear stress varies as body mass to the power −18 and modifies the man to mouse ratio to 1:8. The allometry and values of temporal gradient of shear stress also change: $\\frac{\\partial\\tau}{\\partial t}$ varies as $M^{\\frac{-3}{8}}$ instead of $M^{\\frac{-5}{8}}$ at larger masses, and the 1:150 ratio from man to mouse becomes 1:61. Lastly, we show that the unsteady component of blood flow does not influence the constant allometry of peak velocity on body mass: $u_{\\max}\\sim M^0$. This work extends our knowledge on the dependence of hemodynamic parameters on body mass and paves the way for a more precise extrapolation of in-vivo measurements to humans and bigger mammals.","tags":["Collaboration"],"title":"Influence of pulsatile blood flow on allometry of aortic wall shear stress","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Welcome to Slides Academic\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
