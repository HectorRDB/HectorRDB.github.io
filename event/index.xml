      <title>Trajectory Inference across conditions - differential expression and differential progression</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), gene expression is assessed at the level of single cells. In dynamic biological systems, it may not be appropriate to assign cells to discrete groups, but rather a continuum of cell states may be observed, e.g. the differentiation of a stem cell population into mature cell types. This is often represented as a trajectory in a reduced dimension of the scRNA-seq dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many methods have been suggested for trajectory inference. However, in this setting, it is often unclear how one should handle multiple biological groups or conditions, e.g. constructing and comparing the differentiation trajectory of a wild type versus a knock-out stem cell population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, we will explore methods for comparing multiple conditions in a trajectory inference analysis. We start by integrating datasets from multiple conditions into a single trajectory. By comparing the conditions along the trajectory’s path, we can detect large-scale changes, indicative of differential progression. We also demonstrate how to detect subtler changes by finding genes that exhibit different behaviors between these conditions along a differentiation path.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trajectory inference, Differential Expression and clustering along developmental trajectories in single cell RNA-Sequencing.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trajectory inference is often used with single-cell RNA-seq data to study dynamic changes in gene expression levels during, e.g., cell cycle, differentiation, or cellular activation.  Downstream of trajectory inference, researchers are often interested in discovering genes that are associated with a particular lineage in the trajectory. Furthermore, genes that are differentially expressed between developmental/activational lineages might be highly relevant to the system under study. Current data analysis procedures, however, artificially cluster cells and assess differential expression between the clusters, which fails to exploit the continuous resolution provided by trajectory inference. Other methods only assess broad differences in gene expression between lineages, hence failing to pinpoint the exact types of divergence. Our new method allows flexible inference of (i) within-lineage differential expression by detecting associations between gene expression and pseudotime over an entire lineage, or comparing gene expression between points/regions within the linage; and (ii) between-lineage differential expression by comparing gene expression between lineages over the entire lineages or at specific points/regions. This talk gives a high-level overview of the  method, demonstrating its modularity and unique capacity to deliver powerful insights into complex biological phenomenons.&lt;/p&gt;
