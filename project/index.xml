      <description>ESCAPE Easy Single-Cell RNA-sequencing Analyis through a Political Example Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a very potent biological tool used for many applications. A far from exhaustive list would include identifying new cell types, finding differentially expressed (DE) genes, and discovering lineages among cells. To get an overview of the principle, see here.
However, the usual framework might seem a little daunting for beginners and, while many well-crafted tutorials exists, they all share the same idea: use a biological dataset as an example.</description>

      <description>This is a package to load useful functions that I use on a daily basis. It also contains a template for an Rmd and RStudio Project template. The package website is available at https://hectorrdb.github.io/DailyHRB/.
You can install it from Github with the following:
if (!&amp;quot;devtools&amp;quot; %in% installed.packages()) { install.pacakges(&amp;quot;devtools&amp;quot;) } devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;HectorRDB/DailyHRB&amp;quot;)  or from source with
git clone git@github.com:HectorRDB/DailyHRB.git R CMD INSTALL DailyHRB  </description>

      <description>Modelization of single-cell gene expression along a timeline Report abstract The explosion of genomic data over the past two decades created a need for new and more performing tools. One type of data in particular, Single-cell RNA Sequencing data, allow for a cell-level detection of biological patterns but technical limitations add lots of noise sources to the data. In particular, some counts are dropped and appear as zeros, even thought the gene is expressed in the cell.</description>

      <description>STAT 215A Statistical Models: Theory and Application I took this class in the Fall 2017, with Bin Yu and Rebecca Barter. For the purpose of this class, we studied 3 datasets across 4 labs. The grading was partly peer-reviewed based so my github for this class contains works from other students that I cannot share. However, the lab reports and code files are below:
    Lab 1: Redwood trees Lab 2: Linguistic Survey Lab 3: Linguistic Survey Stability Lab 4: Cloud detection     Report Lab1 Lab2 Lab3 Lab4   Code Lab1 Lab2 Lab3 Lab4    Likewise, for the final report, the project report and code are accessible.</description>

      <description>Overview Recently, Philippe Boileau joined the Dudoit lab and I had to think on which resources to point him to so that he could start getting up to speed with on the field. Together, we hence build the following list of interesting material. Those fall into 4 broad (and largely overlapping) categories:
 How to produce data with sequencing How to find, access and pre-process data (including how to use bio-informatics tools) How to analyze the data: statistics How to use all of the above to conduct an analysis (with - of course - a strong emphasis on R tools) How to do all those analyses correctly: reproducible research  I&amp;rsquo;ll therefore try to list resources to help in all subjects.</description>

      <description>tradeSeq: Trajectory-based differential expression analysis for single-cell sequencing data Work in collaboration with Koen Van den Berge, Kelly Street, Wouter Saelens, Robrecht Cannoodt, Yvan Saeys, Sandrine Dudoit and Lieven Clement
Abstract: Trajectory inference has radically enhanced single-cell RNA-seq research by enabling the study of dynamic changes in gene expression levels during biological processes such as the cell cycle, cell type differentiation, and cellular activation. Downstream of trajectory inference, it is vital to discover genes that are associated with the lineages in the trajectory to illuminate the underlying biological processes.</description>
