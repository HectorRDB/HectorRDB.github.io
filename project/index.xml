      <description>Modelization of single-cell gene expression along a timeline Report abstract The explosion of genomic data over the past two decades created a need for new and more performing tools. One type of data in particular, Single-cell RNA Sequencing data, allow for a cell-level detection of biological patterns but technical limitations add lots of noise sources to the data. In particular, some counts are dropped and appear as zeros, even thought the gene is expressed in the cell.</description>

      <description>STAT 215A Statistical Models: Theory and Application I took this class in the Fall 2017, with Bin Yu and Rebecca Barter. For the purpose of this class, we studied 3 datasets across 4 labs. The grading was partly peer-reviewed based so my github for this class contains works from other students that I cannot share. However, the lab reports and code files are below:
    Lab 1: Redwood trees Lab 2: Linguistic Survey Lab 3: Linguistic Survey Stability Lab 4: Cloud detection     Report Lab1 Lab2 Lab3 Lab4   Code Lab1 Lab2 Lab3 Lab4    Likewise, for the final report, the project report and code are accessible.</description>

      <description>[THIS IS A DRAFT] Overview Recently, a new member joined the Dudoit lab and I had to think on which ressources to point him to so that he could start getting up to speed with on the field. I think that the ressources I recommand fall into 4 broad (and largely overlapping) categories:
 How to produce data with sequencing How to find, acess and pre-process data (including how to use bio-informatics tools) How to analyze the data: statistics How to use all of the above to conduct an analysis (with - of course - a strong emphasis on R tools)  I&amp;rsquo;ll therefore try to list ressources to help in all subjects.</description>
