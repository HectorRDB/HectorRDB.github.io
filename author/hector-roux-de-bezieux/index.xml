      <title>Medical Food Assessment Using a Smartphone App With Continuous Glucose Monitoring Sensors: Proof-of-Concept Study</title>
      <link>http://hector-rdb.org/publication/jmir/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2021 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; Novel wearable biosensors, ubiquitous smartphone ownership, and telemedicine are converging to enable new paradigms of clinical research. A new generation of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices provides access to clinical-grade measurement of interstitial glucose levels. Adoption of these sensors has become widespread for the management of type 1 diabetes and is accelerating in type 2 diabetes. In parallel, individuals are adopting health-related smartphone-based apps to monitor and manage care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt; We conducted a proof-of-concept study to investigate the potential of collecting robust, annotated, real-time clinical study measures of glucose levels without clinic visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; Self-administered meal-tolerance tests were conducted to assess the impact of a proprietary synbiotic medical food on glucose control in a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2×2 cross-over pilot study (n=6). The primary endpoint was incremental glucose measured using Abbott Freestyle Libre CGM devices associated with a smartphone app that provided a visual diet log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; All subjects completed the study and mastered CGM device usage. Over 40 days, 3000 data points on average per subject were collected across three sensors. No adverse events were recorded, and subjects reported general satisfaction with sensor management, the study product, and the smartphone app, with an average self-reported satisfaction score of 8.25/10. Despite a lack of sufficient power to achieve statistical significance, we demonstrated that we can detect meaningful changes in the postprandial glucose response in real-world settings, pointing to the merits of larger studies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt; We have shown that CGM devices can provide a comprehensive picture of glucose control without clinic visits. CGM device usage in conjunction with our custom smartphone app can lower the participation burden for subjects while reducing study costs, and allows for robust integration of multiple valuable data types with glucose levels remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trial Registration:&lt;/strong&gt; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04424888; &lt;a href=&#34;http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04424888&#34;&gt;http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04424888&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trajectory Inference across conditions - differential expression and differential progression</title>
      <link>http://hector-rdb.org/talk/trajectory-inference-across-conditions-differential-expression-and-differential-progression/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), gene expression is assessed at the level of single cells. In dynamic biological systems, it may not be appropriate to assign cells to discrete groups, but rather a continuum of cell states may be observed, e.g. the differentiation of a stem cell population into mature cell types. This is often represented as a trajectory in a reduced dimension of the scRNA-seq dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many methods have been suggested for trajectory inference. However, in this setting, it is often unclear how one should handle multiple biological groups or conditions, e.g. constructing and comparing the differentiation trajectory of a wild type versus a knock-out stem cell population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, we will explore methods for comparing multiple conditions in a trajectory inference analysis. We start by integrating datasets from multiple conditions into a single trajectory. By comparing the conditions along the trajectory’s path, we can detect large-scale changes, indicative of differential progression. We also demonstrate how to detect subtler changes by finding genes that exhibit different behaviors between these conditions along a differentiation path.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trajectory inference, Differential Expression and clustering along developmental trajectories in single cell RNA-Sequencing.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trajectory inference is often used with single-cell RNA-seq data to study dynamic changes in gene expression levels during, e.g., cell cycle, differentiation, or cellular activation.  Downstream of trajectory inference, researchers are often interested in discovering genes that are associated with a particular lineage in the trajectory. Furthermore, genes that are differentially expressed between developmental/activational lineages might be highly relevant to the system under study. Current data analysis procedures, however, artificially cluster cells and assess differential expression between the clusters, which fails to exploit the continuous resolution provided by trajectory inference. Other methods only assess broad differences in gene expression between lineages, hence failing to pinpoint the exact types of divergence. Our new method allows flexible inference of (i) within-lineage differential expression by detecting associations between gene expression and pseudotime over an entire lineage, or comparing gene expression between points/regions within the linage; and (ii) between-lineage differential expression by comparing gene expression between lineages over the entire lineages or at specific points/regions. This talk gives a high-level overview of the  method, demonstrating its modularity and unique capacity to deliver powerful insights into complex biological phenomenons.&lt;/p&gt;
