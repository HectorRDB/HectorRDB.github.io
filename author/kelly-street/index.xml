      <title>Trajectory Inference across conditions - differential expression and differential progression</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), gene expression is assessed at the level of single cells. In dynamic biological systems, it may not be appropriate to assign cells to discrete groups, but rather a continuum of cell states may be observed, e.g. the differentiation of a stem cell population into mature cell types. This is often represented as a trajectory in a reduced dimension of the scRNA-seq dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many methods have been suggested for trajectory inference. However, in this setting, it is often unclear how one should handle multiple biological groups or conditions, e.g. constructing and comparing the differentiation trajectory of a wild type versus a knock-out stem cell population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, we will explore methods for comparing multiple conditions in a trajectory inference analysis. We start by integrating datasets from multiple conditions into a single trajectory. By comparing the conditions along the trajectory’s path, we can detect large-scale changes, indicative of differential progression. We also demonstrate how to detect subtler changes by finding genes that exhibit different behaviors between these conditions along a differentiation path.&lt;/p&gt;
