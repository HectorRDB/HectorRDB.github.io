      <description>[THIS IS A DRAFT] Overview Recently, a new member joined the Dudoit lab and I had to think on which ressources to point him to so that he could start getting up to speed with on the field. I think that the ressources I recommand fall into 4 broad (and largely overlapping) categories:
 Biology and techniques How to find, acess and pre-process data (including how to use bio-informatics tools) Statistics How to use all of the above to conduct an analysis (with - of course - a strong emphasis on R tools)  I&amp;rsquo;ll therefore try to list ressources to help in all subjects.</description>
